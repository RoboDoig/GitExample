function d = birthdaycandles(len,wid)
% It's Cody's 5th birthday, and you've been tasked with putting the candles on the cake. Your goal is to maximize the distance between the 5 required candles.

% Given a rectangular cake with specified length and width, return the highest possible minimum distance between any two candles.

% Important notes

%    You may assume that a candle can be placed directly on the edge of the cake (even though that would be physically challenging!).
%    Required tolerance: <0.01
